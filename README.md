# Pokémon Fetch API
## Using [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co) I've created an application to fetch and display datas for every Pokémon (from Gen 1 to Gen 9). At the moment, it only uses english names.

## Description
You are free to use this and edit the code as you wish. However, keep in mind that I push my projects to GitHub only for fun. If you encounter an issue with my code or don't understand something, I won't be able to help you asap and you might want to ask someone else or ChatGPT for that.

Anyway, have fun! :)
